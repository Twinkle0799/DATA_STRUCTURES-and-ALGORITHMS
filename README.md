## Arrays

1. Max element and it's index in Array
2. Searching in Array
3. Array_Reversal Without extra space
4. Array_Inverse
5. Array_mirror_inverse

6. Sorting (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)
7. Intersection of Arrays
8. Pair Sum of Array
9. Sum of Arrays

10. Wave Print (row wise 2D array)
11. Wave Print (col wise 2D array)
12. Spiral print (2D array)
13. antiSpiral print (2D array)

## Recursion 

#### All the following programs should use recursion

1. print increasing decreasing sequence
2. patterns using recusrion
3. check if array is Sorted using recursion
4. searching in array using Recusrion

5. first index of an element in array
6. last index of an element in array
7. print all the indices of the element appeared 
8. check if the array is palindromic or not

9. reverse an array
10. print the sum of numbers in a string
11. convert the string number in an integer number
12. check is string2 is the reverse of string1

13. check if a string is palindrome or not
14. replace duplicate character of a string with *
15. reduce the duplicate element
16. move the character "x" present in a string to end

17. count the number of times a word appears in a string
18. remove all the occurrences of a word in a string

##### Get Recursion (Create an ArrayList and return)
19. print Subsequences
20. Print Ascii Subsequences
21. Function to print the permutation of the string.
22. print all the possible board paths (diagonals of square mtx) from current to end

23. print all the possible board path with initial dice as 1 or 6
24. print all the possible maze path (no diagonal)
25. print all possible maze path (with diagonal)
26. print all possible maze path (with moves)

27. print all possible outcomes of n coin tosses
28. parenthesis combination 

##### Print Recusrion (Creating ans side by side while going up or down in recursion stack)
29. print subSequences
30. print ASCII subSeq
31. print permutation
32. board path

33. mazePath
34. mazePath Diagonal
